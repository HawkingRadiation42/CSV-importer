# CSV-importer
Import Csv is a web application where the user can import there csv data into the appwrite database.It helps to solve the problem of manually inserting the data into database by simply uploading the csv file and user can see the data get's stored into the appwrite database.

The user must need to signup first to avail the service.
For that I have made use of appwrite sdk for login,signup and creating session of the user.
